# Pinecone_embed_all-MiniLM-L6-v2-sentence-transformer-model


## Semantic PDF Content Search with Vector Embeddings

A  project that extracts text from PDF documents, creates semantic embeddings using SentenceTransformers, and enables intelligent search functionality through Pinecone vector database. The system converts PDF content into searchable vectors, allowing users to query documents using natural language rather than exact keyword matching.

##Data Flow Diagram & System architecture
![dfd](https://github.com/Torajabu/Pinecone_embed_all-MiniLM-L6-v2-sentence-transformer-model/blob/main/dfd.svg)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pinecone API key (free tier available)
- PDF files for processing
- Internet connection for initial model download

### Dependencies
```bash
sentence-transformers>=2.0.0
pinecone-client>=3.0.0
PyPDF2>=3.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0
```

## Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Torajabu/Pinecone_embed_all-MiniLM-L6-v2-sentence-transformer-model/tree/main
cd pinecone-pdf

# Install required packages
pip install sentence-transformers pinecone-client PyPDF2

# Or using requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository or download the script.

2. Sign up for a free Pinecone account and get your API key from the Pinecone console.

3. Update the script with your configuration:
```python
# Update these variables in pinecone_demo.py
PINECONE_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
PDF_PATH = "/path/to/your/document.pdf"
INDEX_NAME = "your-index-name"
```

4. Execute the script:
```bash
python3 pinecone.py
```

The script will extract PDF content, create embeddings, upload to Pinecone, and demonstrate search functionality with example queries.

## Output

The program generates:
- **Text extraction** from PDF with page-by-page organization
- **Semantic embeddings** using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (384 dimensions)
- **Chunked content** with configurable overlap for better context preservation
- **Vector database storage** in Pinecone with searchable metadata
- **Search results** ranked by semantic similarity scores

## How It Works

1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 to extract raw text from each page of the PDF document
2. **Text Chunking**: Splits extracted content into overlapping segments for optimal embedding quality
3. **Embedding Generation**: Converts text chunks into 384-dimensional vectors using SentenceTransformers
4. **Vector Storage**: Uploads embeddings with metadata to Pinecone serverless index
5. **Semantic Search**: Processes natural language queries into vectors and retrieves similar content

## Technical Implementation Behind the System

The system leverages transformer-based embeddings to capture semantic meaning rather than relying on exact text matching. The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model creates dense vector representations where semantically similar content clusters together in high-dimensional space.

```python
# Core embedding process
embeddings = model.encode(text_chunks)  # Text â†’ Vector
similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(query_vector, document_vectors)
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Semantic Embeddings**: Dense vectors capturing meaning beyond keywords
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angular distance between vectors for relevance ranking
- **Chunking Strategy**: Overlapping segments preserve context across boundaries
- **Vector Database**: Enables sub-linear search time complexity for large document collections

## Performance Metrics

- **Embedding Speed**: ~50-100 chunks per second (CPU-dependent)
- **Search Latency**: <100ms for queries (Pinecone serverless)
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB for model + document processing
- **Index Capacity**: 100,000 vectors (free tier), scalable to millions

## Usage Tips

- Use chunk sizes of 300-800 characters for optimal embedding quality
- Include 20-50 character overlap between chunks to preserve context
- Test queries with natural language rather than exact text matches
- Monitor Pinecone usage to stay within free tier limits (100,000 queries/month)

## Troubleshooting

- **No search results**: Ensure index has time to become ready after upserts (wait 5-10 seconds)
- **Embedding dimension mismatch**: Verify all embeddings use the same model consistently
- **PDF extraction errors**: Check file permissions and PDF format compatibility
- **Pinecone connection issues**: Validate API key and verify internet connectivity


## Applications

- **Document Management**: Enable semantic search across large document repositories
- **Research Tools**: Quick content discovery within academic papers and reports
- **Knowledge Base Systems**: Intelligent FAQ and documentation search functionality
- **Content Analysis**: Automated categorization and similarity detection for content libraries

## Post Mortem Notes

### What Worked Well
- **SentenceTransformers Integration**: The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model provided excellent semantic understanding with manageable computational requirements
- **Pinecone Serverless**: Zero-configuration vector database eliminated infrastructure complexity while providing production-grade search performance
- **Chunking Strategy**: Overlapping text segments effectively preserved context boundaries and improved search relevance

### Challenges Encountered
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Complex document layouts and formatting caused inconsistent text extraction quality, requiring additional preprocessing
- **Embedding Dimensionality**: Initial attempts with larger models (768-dim) exceeded free tier storage limits, necessitating model optimization
- **Query Timing**: Pinecone index initialization delays caused empty search results when queries executed immediately after data upload

### Lessons Learned
- **Model Selection Trade-offs**: Smaller embedding models can provide sufficient accuracy while reducing storage and compute costs significantly
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Vector databases require proper timing considerations between write and read operations for consistency
- **Text Preprocessing**: Document structure varies dramatically; robust chunking strategies must handle edge cases like page headers and fragmented sentences

### Future Improvements
- **Multi-format Support**: Extend beyond PDF to support DOCX, HTML, and plain text document processing
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic embeddings with traditional keyword matching for comprehensive search coverage
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement incremental document processing for dynamic content without full re-indexing

### Performance Insights
- **Batch Processing**: Grouping embeddings into batches of 100 vectors reduced API calls by 95% and improved upload throughput significantly
- **Memory Optimization**: Processing documents in streaming fashion prevents memory exhaustion with large PDF collections
- **Cache Strategy**: Local embedding caching reduces redundant model inference when processing similar document sections

## Important Notes

- The system requires an active internet connection for initial model download (approximately 90MB)
- Pinecone free tier includes 100,000 vectors and 100,000 queries per month limitations
- Search quality depends heavily on document text extraction accuracy and chunking strategy
- Processing time scales linearly with document size; large PDFs may require several minutes for complete indexing
